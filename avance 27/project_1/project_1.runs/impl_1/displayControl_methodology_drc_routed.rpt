divisor/u1/dataout_reg[7]/CLR, divisor/u1/dataout_reg[8]/CLR,
divisor/u1/dataout_reg[9]/CLR (the first 15 of 32 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell divisor/u1/frecu_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) divisor/frecu_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.

LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell divisor/u1/resetint_reg_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) divisor/resetint_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch divisor/frecu_reg/L7 (in divisor/frecu_reg macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin divisor/frecu_reg/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch divisor/resetint_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin divisor/resetint_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
