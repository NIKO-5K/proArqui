2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u1/cable2_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cable2_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell u1/s1_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) s1_reg/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on reset relative to the rising and/or falling clock edge(s) of sys_clk_pin.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch cable2_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin cable2_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch s1_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin s1_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 2 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
